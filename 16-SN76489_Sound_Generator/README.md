# SN76489 Digital Complex Sound Generator

Here are the resources for the SN76489 project.  This folder contains datasheets, application report and an Electronic Australian article.

* The [code](code/) folder has the SN76489 Library that can help in generating music on the chip.  It also contains examples and Tiny Basic code.
* The [PCB](PCB/) folder has the PCB files including Schematic and Gerber.  Use these files and create your own.
* The [VGM_Streamer](VGM_Streamer/) folder has the source code in C++ that can read VGM files and send tone data via serial port.  It also contains the VGM [songs](VGM_Streamer/songs).
  
Thanks to [shawty](https://github.com/shawty/sn76489arduino) for his awesome project on VGM streaming!  Also to that mystery person who sent me the test board.  It was a fun project.
